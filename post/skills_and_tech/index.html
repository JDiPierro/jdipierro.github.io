<h4 id="languages">Languages</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently most proficient in <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>Ruby</strong>. I have no problem jumping into <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Groovy</strong>. <strong>Javascript</strong> doesn&rsquo;t (entirely) scare me, and <strong>Typescript</strong> helps me sleep at night. I can find my way around <strong>Go</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, and have even dug through a <strong>Scala</strong> codebase to fix a bug. And just for keywords: I do in fact know <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> (including preprocessors).</p>

<h4 id="frameworks-and-tools">Frameworks and Tools</h4>

<p>When it comes to web frameworks I&rsquo;ve worked with <strong>Rails</strong>, <strong>Grails</strong>, <strong>Meteor</strong>, and <strong>Spring</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>SaltStack</strong> is my favorite configuration management system. I&rsquo;ve had over two years experience using Salt to manage deployments of between 100 and 1000 nodes. I&rsquo;ve also written <strong>Chef</strong> cookbooks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve designed and implemented build pipelines in <strong>Jenkins</strong>, <strong>Gitlab</strong>, and <strong>Bamboo</strong>. Several of which included some level of <strong>continuous integration</strong> to one or more environments.</p>

<p>I favor <strong>Debian</strong> based distros of Linux and have deployed to <strong>AWS</strong> and <strong>Google Cloud</strong>. I can write <strong>upstart</strong> and <strong>systemd</strong> jobs in my sleep and configure <strong>nginx</strong> or <strong>haproxy</strong> however you need. I like <strong>Sensu</strong> to keep an overseeing eye on the health of systems and <strong>prometheus</strong> for metric tracking.</p>

<p>With <strong>Postgres</strong>, <strong>Cassandra</strong>, and <strong>MongoDB</strong> experience under my belt I can help you scale out your database with or without <strong>SQL</strong> (The latter being <strong>NoSQL</strong> for you buzzword fans).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a problem, Yo I&rsquo;ll solve it!</p>
