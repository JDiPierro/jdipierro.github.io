<p>I&rsquo;m currently most proficient in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Golang</strong> but I&rsquo;d have no problem jumping back into <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, or <strong>Groovy</strong>. <strong>Javascript</strong> doesn&rsquo;t (entirely) scare me but I prefer <strong>Typescript</strong>. I can find my way around <strong>C++</strong> and have even dug through a <strong>Scala</strong> codebase to fix a bug. And just for keywords: I do in fact know <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> (including preprocessors).</p>

<h4 id="other-tools-of-the-trade">Other Tools of the Trade</h4>

<p>When it comes to web frameworks I&rsquo;ve worked with <strong>Rails</strong>, <strong>Grails</strong>, <strong>Meteor</strong>, and <strong>Spring</strong>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with <strong>Docker</strong> and have deployed to self-hosted <strong>Kubernetes</strong> with <strong>Helm</strong> as well as <strong>Amazon ECS</strong> with <strong>CloudFormation</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>SaltStack</strong> is my favorite configuration management system. I&rsquo;ve had over two years experience using Salt to manage deployments of between 100 and 1000 nodes. I&rsquo;ve also written a few <strong>Chef</strong> cookbooks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve designed and implemented build pipelines in <strong>Jenkins</strong>, <strong>Gitlab</strong>, and <strong>Bamboo</strong>. Several of which included some level of <strong>continuous integration</strong> to one or more environments.</p>

<p>Most server I&rsquo;ve worked with run <strong>Debian</strong> based distros of Linux but I&rsquo;ve also worked with <strong>CentOS</strong>. I&rsquo;ve deployed to <strong>AWS</strong> and <strong>Google Cloud</strong>. When available I love to use Datadog for monitoring, but I&rsquo;ve also had peace of mind using <strong>Sensu</strong> for monitoring and <strong>Prometheus</strong> for metric tracking.</p>

<p>As a developer I&rsquo;ve used <strong>Redis</strong>, <strong>Postgres</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and <strong>DynamoDB</strong>. I&rsquo;ve also managed all of the above and <strong>Cassandra</strong> as an SRE. I can help you scale out and optimize your database with or without <strong>SQL</strong> (The latter being <strong>NoSQL</strong> for you buzzword fans).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a problem, Yo I&rsquo;ll solve it!</p>
