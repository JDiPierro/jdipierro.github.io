      <description>WSL - Golang Whitespace Linter This linter enforces that you have whitespace separating different types of code to increase readability. I wanted the ability to also enforce the opposite: Error checks should be cuddled with the line that assigned the error. I added that ability and helped make the linter&amp;rsquo;s code cleaner.

Hashicorp&amp;rsquo;s Terraform I added the ability to import several Google Cloud resources. Check out my closed pulled requests.</description>
